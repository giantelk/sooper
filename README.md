# Sooper
Javascript mobile and desktop experiment to change the world.

# Summary
This is experiment to see if a pile of Open Source developers can change the world with a simple and fun project based on ReactJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Cordova. Something that allows us to learn, have fun, and build something so cool and amazing it has the power to move mountains and change the world for the better. 

# Vision
Change the world.

# What ??
There are some basic rules as outlined below regarding tooling, libraries, etc. However before we start writing code, we need to decide WHAT ! So leave your feedback as a github issue. 

As the project grows we'll set up a more 'formal' communication channel, i.e. Google Groups or Stack Overflow.

# TODO items
- High Level Requirements doc, i.e. What is the What?
- Functional Requirements doc i.e. Software requirements, more detailed What's.
- UI Design
- Code away

# Tooling
The following tooling / libraries are suggested.
## Client
- ReactJS
- Flux (pure implementation)
- CSS

## Server
- ExpressJS
- NodeJS
- MongoDB

## Build tools
- Gulp
- Browserify
- Cordova

## Standards
- pure JavaScript in client & server. 
- Use Google JavaScript style guide as reference. http://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml

# Internal Communication
For now use GitHub issues to post questions and answers. In the future we can use Google Groups and/or StackOverflow, and Google Hangouts for text/video chat. 

Google Apps can be used to review requirements docs.

Trello should be good for the roadmap.
