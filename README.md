# Sooper
Javascript mobile and desktop experiment to change the world.

`Sooper` as in Supernatural, or Super Duper.

# Summary
This is an experiment to see if a pile of Open Source developers can change the world with a simple and fun project based on MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, (MERN stack) & Cordova. 

Something that allows us to learn, have fun, and build something so cool and amazing it has the power to move mountains and change the world for the better. 

# Vision
Change the world. 

# What is Sooper?
Before we start writing code, we need to decide WHAT ! So leave your ideas as a github issue. https://github.com/giantelk/sooper/issues

As the project grows we'll set up a more 'formal' communication channel, i.e. Google Groups or Stack Overflow.

There are some basic rules as outlined below regarding tooling, libraries, etc.

# TODO items
- High Level Requirements doc, i.e. What is the What?
- Roadmap
- Functional Requirements doc i.e. Software requirements, more detailed What's.
- UI Design
- Software Design spec
- Code away

# Tooling
The following tooling / libraries will be used.

## Requirements
Google Apps can be used to write & review requirements docs.

## Roadmap
- Mobile 1st.
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) the MVP, i.e. quick, iterative releases.

Trello should be good to use for the roadmap.
www.trello.com

## Design
Sketch (can use photoshop too), however Sketch is preferred. http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch

## Client
- ReactJS (Once React Native is fully baked on both iOS and Android we can switch mobile code to it).
- Flux (pure implementation)
- pure CSS

## Server
- ExpressJS
- NodeJS
- MongoDB

## Build tools
- Gulp
- Browserify
- Cordova (NOT PhoneGap)

## Standards
- Pure JavaScript on client & server. 
- Exceptions may be Python for more intensive server side services.
- Use Google JavaScript style guide as reference. http://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml
- NEVER check code into the `master` branch. Always work from your own fork and branch it.

# Internal Communication
For now use GitHub issues to post questions and answers. In the future we can use Google Groups and/or StackOverflow, and Google Hangouts for text/video chat. 

# Tooling Rational
There's tons of blogs and articles that talk about the benefits and dissadvantages of native mobile VS hybrid. At the end of the day, the tooling selected above is getting great feedback from the developer community... it works, it's also fun and challenging to code with. 

The dream of write once run anywhere is becoming a stronger reality every day. By write once run anywhere, a mobile app and desktop app can share a huge part of the code base. Further, with JavaScript on both client & server it makes development so much smoother.

Without belabouring what you can Google or may already know, NodeJS & MongoDB are fast and efficient. ReactJS's modular approach to web components makes working with teams easier, reducing code soup issues.
